Advanced Car Price Forecasting with Deep Learning (ANN)

Welcome to the Car Price Forecasting project! In this project, we leverage advanced Data Science techniques and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict car prices based on various features. By analyzing attributes such as mileage, fuel type, car brand, and more, we aim to provide accurate price predictions.

Project Overview
This project explores how car attributes like mileage, fuel type, present price, and brand influence the selling price of cars. We utilize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict car prices accurately. The insights derived from this model can help users and businesses in making better decisions for buying or selling cars.

Key Features
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values. This ensures that the model receives high-quality data for training.

ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization
Visualizations like heatmaps and distribution plots are used to explore the relationships between different car features and selling prices. These visualizations help us understand which features are most influential in determining car prices.

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
We employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), built using TensorFlow and Keras, to predict car prices based on the provided dataset. The model is trained over several epochs, using features such as present price, fuel type, and kilometers driven.

ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation
We evaluate the ANN model using performance metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
These metrics help us assess the accuracy of the predictions and fine-tune the model.
